### Local Development
Please note that Mailchimp requires a valid, publicly accessible URL for some of 
the data that is sync'd. This means that if you are using the plugin in a local 
environment that isn't externally accessible some sync tasks will fail. We 
recommend testing the plugin in a staging environment, or using a service like
[ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to make your local environment public.
